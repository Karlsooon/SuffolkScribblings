                It’s been a while since I’ve posted (sorry, I’m still working
                hard on my next book) and hadn’t planned to post but this piece
                from Terry on Rosie’s blog deserves to be spread far and wide.
                <br />

                If you are an author and you ask someone for their honest
                opinion of your work, don’t get upset if they give it. Book
                bloggers are treasures. They should be encouraged, praised, and
                if possible given red wine and chocolates. These wonderful
                people give up their time, for free, to review books. And as
                every book is a piece of art, whether they like it or not is
                subjective (if you don’t believe me, look up the one-star
                reviews on your favourite book). <br />

                A well-thought out review is a gift, whether positive or
                negative, and if you don’t think you can react well to somebody
                not liking your book, then you should think long and hard about
                publishing it at all.

                I have to admit, I was a little dubious about NaNoWriMo before
                starting. Yes, I saw the value of creating a community of
                like-minded individuals all focussing on one goal, but at the
                same time 1667 words a day, while not a huge amount on a single
                day, is a lot of writing day in, day out, for a month.
                <br />
                <br />
                From a personal point of view, the month of November wasn’t
                exactly quiet. Along with work and being there for my family,
                I’d also recently taken on learning a set of songs for a duet,
                there was my oldest son’s tenth birthday split over two weekends
                (as the birthday fell on a Wednesday) and I had committed to
                starting a cricket coaching course at the end of the month,
                ruling out more weekend writing time.
                <br />
                <br />
                Yet in the end, I did it and with more than a week to spare!
                <br />So what have I learned? <br />
                <br />I know I work well to deadlines with my job but this was
                the first self-imposed deadline I’ve had for my writing and it
                really drove me on. By committing publicly to delivering
                something I found I was planning my days better, snatching the
                odd 30 minutes writing time when I could instead of sitting in
                front of the box, and generally doing all I could – without
                upsetting my family – to hit my goal. <br />
                <br />2 I can write faster than I thought <br />
                <br />When writing my first three novels, on a good day i could
                hit between 2000 to 2500 words. My best was just over 3000
                words, yet there were a number of times during the past month
                where I wrote well over 4000 words in a day. This may have had
                something to do with the story itself, having a clear target or
                just generally being more focussed, but when writing in the
                future my expectations of what’s achievable has changed. <br />
                <br />3 Not stopping to edit works <br />
                <br />I’ve always been a believer of not looking back when
                writing your first draft but this year I took it a step further
                than I’ve done in the past. Where I used to correct the odd
                sentence or paragraph I was which I was particularly unhappy,
                for NaNoWriMo I just left comments in red all over my MS on
                areas I felt needed work or where I had a change of plan, but
                then carried on going. While this was a great help to hit the
                word count, it will be interesting to see how the first rewrite
                goes! <br />
                <br />4 The joy of overwriting <br />
                <br />One of my favourite discoveries during NaNoWriMo was how
                much fun over-writing is. What do I mean by this? In my case it
                was allowing myself to describe settings or characters in more
                detail than was needed, or to write far too much exposition than
                would be in the final book. This is a big change for me. I
                usually write sparingly and go back to add further detail later,
                but this time around over-writing really helped me get under the
                skin of the world and the story I created. I know a lot of what
                I’ve written will be (rightly) cut during the edit but it has
                been fun letting myself go a allowing myself time to explore the
                people and settings I’ve created. <br />
                <br />5 I’ve been introduced to even more lovely writers
                <br />
                <br />I’ve always maintained that one of the best things about
                writing is the supportive community, and through NaNoWriMo I’ve
                got to meet a lot of new supportive and encouraging writers.
                Sadly I haven’t been able to go to any meet ups but the response
                on the NaNoWriMo regional message board has been really
                positive. Next year I’ll definitely attend. <br />
                <br />
                Of course, my first draft isn’t finished. I’m not sure whether
                I’ll hit my extended goal of finishing it by the end of the
                month but it will be really close and I can’t wait to then get
                my teeth into it and start editing in the new year. <br />
                <br />
                So what about you? If you’ve taken part in NaNoWriMo this year,
                what has been your experience? If you haven’t, have I persuaded
                you to do it next year? I look forward to hearing from you.
                <br />

              <p>
                As you can probably tell with the lack of posts and minimal
                comments on other blogs or social media platforms, I am still
                thoroughly engrossed in NaNoWriMo 2016. The good news is that
                I’m still flying. I don’t know whether it is the book idea or
                whether it is the fixed goal of 50K words in a month, but on my
                full writing days I’m achieving between 3000 and 4000 words a
                day, even on days where I feel I’m trying to chisel each word
                out of rock one at a time. This compares to 2000 on a good day
                when writing my previous novels. If there’s only one thing I
                take away from this process, it’s that I can write a lot faster
                than I originally thought. <br />
                <br />
                <br />The story itself is progressing nicely. I’m still in love
                with my main characters, the world is filling out nicely and
                there haven’t been too many deviations from plan. I do know,
                however, that there will be a lot of work to do during the edit.
                <br />
                <br /><br />
                Also, the story went through a dark phase last week – a prime
                example of art reflecting life. I found myself rewriting
                sections because this is a book aimed at older children, and
                while there’s nothing wrong with scaring children a little bit –
                look at Roald Dahl’s stories for example – I don’t want to
                traumatise them. That said, I’ve now come out the other side –
                at least in my writing – and I’m still on course to beat the
                50000 words by the end of November. In fact, as you can see
                there is a good chance I’ll pass that mark next week!
                <br /><br /><br />

                />
                <br /><br /><br />
                <br />This then leads me on to my next challenge. I’ve estimated
                that the whole of this draft will be around 65,000 words, so my
                new target is to try to finish the full draft by the end of the
                month. This is going to be tight as my weekends are fairly
                booked up between now and then, but it’s good to keep on
                pushing. <br />
                So how are the rest of you getting on? I’d love to hear from
                you. <br />
